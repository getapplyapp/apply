# apps/web — Claude instructions

> For git conventions and monorepo structure, see the root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

## Stack

- **Framework** — Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Components)
- **Language** — TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Auth** — Supabase Auth (Google and LinkedIn OIDC)
- **Database** — Supabase PostgreSQL for signed-in users (Row Level Security); the public demo (`demo.applyspace.app`, host-based, see `lib/demo-host.ts`) is served from memory (`lib/demo.ts`) and never reads a session; every other host requires sign-in; no local database (the desktop app signs in and uses Supabase too)
- **Deployment** — Vercel
- **Package manager** — pnpm
- **Demo account** — a fictional seeded user for previews (`/auth/demo`, `scripts/demo-seed.mts`); the public demo stays read-only and sends no analytics; see `docs/demo-account.md`

## Code conventions

- Components: PascalCase (`JobCard.tsx`, `AppShell.tsx`)
- Utilities and lib files: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`, `jobs.ts`)
- Named exports only — no default exports
- Shared app types live in `packages/core` (`@apply/core/[domain]`), not in the web app
- Server Components by default — use `'use client'` only when necessary (interactivity, hooks)

## Public website (same app)

- The marketing website lives in this app: pages in `src/app/(site)/site/[locale]` (internal URLs `/site/en/...`), code in `src/site` (components, content, lib), plus `src/app/og`, `src/app/sitemap.xml`, `src/app/robots.txt`, `src/app/api/revalidate`.
- Routing (`src/lib/site-routing.ts`, unit-tested, used by `src/proxy.ts`): signed-out visitors see the website on `/`, `/product`, `/pricing`, `/resources/*`; signed-in users never see it (`/` is Home, marketing pages redirect to `/`). Internal `/site/...` and `/en/...` URLs redirect to the clean public URL.
- Website files use the `.site.tsx` / `.site.ts` extension. `pnpm build:desktop` sets `APPLY_DESKTOP_BUILD=1`, so `next.config.ts` drops that extension from `pageExtensions` and the website is never compiled into the .dmg (and `APPLY_SITE_ENABLED=0` turns the routing off). Never import `@/site/*` from app code.
- Two root layouts: `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` (product) and `src/app/(site)/site/[locale]/layout.site.tsx` (website, static, its own CSS `src/site/site.css`).
- Sanity Studio: `studio/` at the repo root.
- Homepage sections are typed in `src/site/content/types.ts` and rendered by `SectionRenderer` (server components). No screenshots: every product visual is a live demo in `src/site/components/demos`, picked by a `demo` key (`board`, `applications`, `search`, `interviews`, `profile`). Each demo is a pure view (`*Screen.tsx`, `BoardView.tsx`, `HubViews.tsx`) rendered on the server in its first state, swapped by `DemoIsland` for the live client component (`*Demo.tsx`, own chunk) when it nears the viewport (the hero right after idle). Demo data (Camille Aubert, invented companies, fixed dates) is in `demos/data.ts`. Never import app components or `@/lib/*` there; keep demos dependency-free, at a fixed height (no layout shift), with reduced-motion and 375px layouts.
- First-load JS budget of site pages: 170 kB gzip. PostHog is not in it: the app initialises it in `components/analytics/posthogInit.ts` (imported by `Providers`); the website fetches `SiteAnalytics` on idle, asks for consent, then loads posthog-js for page views and CTA clicks only (`website_cta_clicked`, see `docs/analytics-taxonomy.md`).
- "Download for macOS" opens `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL`, or the homepage `#download` section while it is unset. Never show job board names or counts, or figures that depend on a plan (prices, limits) outside `/pricing`.

# Website content plan

Linear: WEB-9 (team Website, project Website; formerly APP-138). Site code: `apps/web/src/site` and `apps/web/src/app/(site)` (same Next app as the product, see `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`). Copy is English first; French comes later through the same content model (`locale`), starting from the FR reference headline "Votre recherche d'emploi, enfin centralisée".

Titles below are the page part only: the template appends " | applyspace" (Home uses its full title).

## Principles

- Product name is **applyspace** in running text; the logo reads "Apply" (never altered). Domain `applyspace.app`.
- Never use "hunt"/"hunting". Tagline to keep: "Find the right offers, track your applications and prepare your interviews."
- Calm, factual, short sentences. No claim the product does not do today. The site is written as if everything works: no "Soon", "coming soon" or "planned" labels (decision of 10 Oct, launch happens once everything is wired).
- AI features run on the user's own AI accounts (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini). The site never promises "free AI".
- All data lives in the cloud (hosted database, per-user access rules). Never say data or sessions stay on the device. Do not over-claim security.
- One primary call to action everywhere: **Start for free** (app login/onboarding). Secondary: **Sign in**.
- Prices are shown plainly (Free €0, Plus €0.99, Max €3.99 per month), without tags.

## Information architecture

| Route | Purpose | Primary keyword intent |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Home, short | job search tracker, job application tracker |
| `/product` | Features by theme, one anchor per feature | job application tracking software, job search app |
| `/resources` | Article list (Sanity) | job search guides |
| `/resources/[slug]` | Article template | long tail, per article |
| `/pricing` | Free / Plus / Max + FAQ | job search app pricing |

Routes are generated under `[locale]` (`en` only now, unprefixed URLs). Adding `fr` later means a new content set and `locales` entry; hreflang is generated from that list.

Header: logo (left), nav centre (Product, Resources, Pricing), right: **Sign in** (secondary), **Start for free** (primary). Mobile: logo + menu button, panel with the same links and both buttons.
Footer: Product / Resources / Pricing links, Sign in, copyright, privacy and terms placeholders (pages to write, see Open items).

## Home (`/`)

- **Title tag**: applyspace: your job search, finally in one space (≤ 60 chars)
- **Meta description**: Find the right offers, track your applications and prepare your interviews, all in one space. Free to start. (≤ 155)
- **H1**: Your job search, finally in one space
- Sub: Find the right offers, track your applications and prepare your interviews.
- CTAs: Start for free / See the product
- Hero visual: screenshot placeholder (Applications board).
- **H2 Three jobs, one space** — three cards linking to Product anchors:
  - Find the right offers — Search several job boards from one space with search profiles that follow your criteria. → `/product#offers-search`
  - Track your applications — Board, table, timeline or map: the same applications, the view you need. → `/product#applications-board`
  - Prepare your interviews — Keep every interview, date and note next to its application. → `/product#interview-tracking`
- **H2 How it works** — 1 Import your resume (applyspace fills your profile, you review) · 2 Set your search (titles, places, contracts, salary) · 3 Apply and follow up.
- **H2 Your data stays yours** — Your data is stored in the cloud and scoped to your account. You choose what to import. AI features use your own AI accounts.
- **H2 Start free, upgrade when you need more** — three plan mini cards (applications 15 / 99 / unlimited) → `/pricing`.
- Final CTA band: Start for free.

JSON-LD: SoftwareApplication with featureList, BreadcrumbList.

## Resources (`/resources`, `/resources/[slug]`)

- **Title**: Resources: guides for a calmer job search | **H1**: Resources | Sub: Practical guides on searching, tracking and interviewing.
- List: card per article (category, title, excerpt, date, reading time). Category filter later.
- Article template: breadcrumb, category, H1, byline + published/updated dates, cover (alt), body (Portable Text: H2/H3, lists, quotes, images with alt, callouts), related articles, CTA band "Track your applications in applyspace".
- JSON-LD: Article (headline, dates, author, image, publisher), BreadcrumbList.
- Seed articles (written, short, to be reviewed by the founder before launch):
  1. How to track your job applications without losing track (statuses, follow-up rhythm)
  2. A simple checklist to prepare a job interview
- Editorial backlog (to brief in Sanity): follow-up email after an interview; how many applications per week; reading a job offer; salary negotiation basics; job search for career changers; ghosted after an interview.

## Pricing (`/pricing`)

- **Title**: Pricing: Free, Plus and Max | **Meta**: Start free with 15 applications. Plus raises the cap to 99 and Max removes limits.
- **H1**: Start free, upgrade when you need more
- Plans (caps match the database triggers):

| | Free | Plus | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price | €0 | €0.99 / mo | €3.99 / mo |
| Applications | 15 | 99 | Unlimited |
| Search profiles | 1 | 3 | Unlimited |
| Interview templates | 1 | 3 | Unlimited |
| Core (tracking, interview prep, resume rewrite, fit messages, job alerts, autofill, AI integrations) | yes | yes | yes |
| Advanced search filters, company insights, network connections, reply tracking, interview calendar sync | no | yes | yes |
| AI interview simulation, shareable progress page, custom offer source | no | no | yes |

Quarterly billing: -15% (not shown on the site). Mismatch to settle: the product decision says archived applications do not count toward the cap, but the database trigger counts every application row. Undecided: the founder is testing the Linear free-plan limit before ruling. The site says only that every saved application counts.
- FAQ (also FAQPage JSON-LD): Is applyspace free? · What counts as an application? · Can I change plan later? · What happens to my data if I go back to Free? (data is kept, possibilities reduced) · Does applyspace pay for AI? (no, use your own AI account) · Where is my data stored? (everything in the cloud, hosted database with per-user access rules).
- CTAs: Start for free on every plan.

## SEO requirements per page

Unique title and description, one H1, logical H2/H3, canonical, Open Graph and Twitter card, JSON-LD as above, image alt, internal links between Home, Product anchors, Pricing and Resources.

## Open items for the founder

- Decided: the app lives on `applyspace.app` itself; the site is what signed-out visitors see. The routing between the two (signed-in vs signed-out on the same origin) is a separate piece of work.
- Privacy policy and terms pages (legal text is not drafted here).
- Homepage visuals are live demos (WEB-13), no screenshots. The /product page still has screenshot placeholders.
- French copy.
